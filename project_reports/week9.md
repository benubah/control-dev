## Day 1 - July 24

Achievements:

Coded `pid` for tests with `feedback`. `pid` is proposed to be created in the 3rd coding phase (Aug. 24), but was achieved in this phase.


## Day 2 - July 25

Achievements:

Coded `connect` Octave style to interconnect state-space models.

It accepts an appended state-space models and interconnects them based on an input/output matrix


## Day 3 - July 26

Achievements:

Coded `ctrb` and `poles` Octave style.

`ctrb` creates a controllability matrix for state-space models.

`poles` obtain the poles of transfer function, state-space and zero-pole models.


## Day 4 - July 27

Achievements:

Coded `polyvalm, acker` and, `place`.

`acker` depends on `ctrb, polyvalm`. `place` is a wrapper for `acker` to provide Octave style functionality for SISO models.
