## Day 1 - Aug. 7

Achievements:

Coded `initial()` to obtain an LTI system's response to initial conditions

`issiso()` to check if a system is a single-input-single-output system


## Day 2 - Aug. 8

Achievements:

Coded `impulse()` to obtain an LTI system's impulse response

`ismimo()` - to check if a system is an multiple-input-multiple-output system


## Day 3 - Aug. 9

Achievements:

Coded `initialplot()` - plot system's initial response

`impulseplot()` - plot system's impulse response


## Day 4 - Aug. 10

Achievements:

Coded `ltifr(), freqresp()` - to obtain the frequency response of a system of transfer-function, state-space or zero-pole model

`freqresp()` uses `freqs()` from the `signal` package to obtain frequency response of transfer function models only.
