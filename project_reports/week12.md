## Day 1 - Aug. 14

Achievements:

Coded `bode() bodeplot()` to obtain the gain and phase response of a given LTI system for different frequencies.

When the system is a transfer function, `bode` uses the `signal` package to obtain frequency response.

`bodeplot` can plot MIMO state-space systems by plotting each input-output pair of the system using `selectsys` iteratively.
