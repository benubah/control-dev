## Day 1 - Aug. 14

Achievements:

Coded `bode() bodeplot()` to obtain the gain and phase response of a given LTI system for different frequencies.

When the system is a transfer function, `bode` uses the `signal` package to obtain frequency response.

`bodeplot` can plot MIMO state-space systems by plotting each input-output pair of the system using `selectsys` iteratively.



## Day 2 - Aug. 15

Achievements:

Coded `nyquist(), nyquistplot()` 


## Day 3 - Aug. 16

Achievements:

Coded `ramp(), rampplot()` to obtain the ramp response of a system



## Day 4 - Aug. 17

Achievements:

Coded `lqr(), ode2ss()`


## Day 5 - Aug. 18

Achievements:
